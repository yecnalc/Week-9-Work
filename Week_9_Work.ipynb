The program should display a menu that lets the user look up a personâ€™s email address, add a new name and email address, change an existing email address, and delete an existing name and email address. The program should pickle the dictionary and save it to a file when the user exits the program. Each time the program starts, it should retrieve the dictionary from the file and unpickle it.When testing this program, use fake names and email addresses.\"   "
